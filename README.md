===========================

this is a special config for compiling
ramdisks of cwm and twrp for C2105/04,
Kernel Developers can implement the 
cpio archives in their kernels as long
as they give me the credits for the 
initial recovery configs in their 
Threads!

Best Regards,

PS: fuckoff twrpgraphics.c ^^
    (it is a piece of shit but seems
     to be working fine xD)
